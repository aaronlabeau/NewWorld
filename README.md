# New World (not final title) - D&D 5th Edition Campaign Setting

This campaign setting is based on the geography of Earth with unique town and location names, races, etc.  This material is designed to be used with the various books that Wizard of the Coast sells as part of the 5th Edition of Dungeon and Dragons.  Anyone using these documents should support the original authors and builders of this game by purchasing the materials needed to properly run the game.  

This is my personal material that I use to run my various D&D Campaign.  I have purchased the books published by Wizards of the Coast and adapt them to the world that I'm building using the material I paid for as I see fit.  

In summary if you steal the Players Handbook, DM Guide, or other materials from sites  you are a jerk and don't deserve to use these materials.  

I am a big supporter of D&D Beyond and Roll20 and believe they are the most convenient ways to run the game.  If you don't like books, the digital form from D&D Beyond or Roll 20 should be purchased instead.  

If you are using the SRD rules which are open and free - you should NOT be using any races that I call out in the Races file as those need separate materials.  The required books to play the game are cheaper than 3 XBox or PS5 games so please do the right thing and buy the books.  Ok rant over - now enjoy the materials provided.
