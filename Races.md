# Races

## Dragonborn

Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped from a curse that was put on the dragons that fought during the War of the Titans, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

- **Description**:  it is rumored that the dragonborn first hatched from Dragon Tooth and Tyon Desert.  A palaced ruled by the Dragonborn is rumored to exist in the Tyon Desert, but none have made from there and lived to tell the tale.

- **Age Range**: Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 100.

## Dwarf

A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.

- **Description**:  Four major groups of dwarves exist in the New World.

  - **East Coast**:  The dwarves from the East Coast came to the lands with the Humans and Halfings during the pilgrimage from the old land.  Once arriving in Echor the dwarves spread to the north and south of the lands - some taking to the mountains of Calmarnock while others ventured into the Frozen Lands.  These dwarves are also called the "Hill Dwarves" in the Players Handbook.  

  - **West Coast**:  The dwarves from the West Coast came to the lands with the Elves, Gnomes, and Tiefling from the lands of Asiah in the Old World.  These dwarves are also called the "Mountain Dwarves" in the Players Handbook.

  - **Frozen North** :  Dwarves from the East and West coasts eventually moved to the northern mountains areas and made there home in the mountains here building large fortrests.  These dwarves are called the "Mark of Warding Dwarf" in D&D Beyond.  

  - **Duergar**:  In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray dwarves. The duergar fled from the lands of the New World when the dwarves and gnomes of from the Old World arrived.  Agreements over land drove them deep underground.  The times living in the dark and locked away from the sun turned them into vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the surface world for captives, then sell their prey to the other races of the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities to become invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size.

- **Age Range**: Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.
