## Introduction

### Orgins of the New World

The contintent of New World was originally ruled by the Dragons and Giants.  These creatures began to conflict with each other which eventually broke out into the first war, which some call the Great War.  During this time many artifacts from both races were lost and the number of Giants and Dragons were greatly reduced. 

The continent of New World was discovered by a group of light skinned humans and elves from the land of Eurtopia (Europe) over 500 years ago (BT - Before Titans War) when they settled the East Coast in the Echor.  Word from the old land spread and a seperate group of mostly Elves and a small amount of dwarves, gnomes, halfings, and dark skinned humans settled the West Coast (Dor - o tuar and Puig Gwilith) from Eshiya (Asia).  

The New World became a challenge as the land was already inhabited by:

- Dragons
- Giants
- Tabaxi
- Kenku
- Lizardfolk
- Orc
- Yuan-ti Pureblood
- Dwarves
- Elves
- Many monsters 

The elves on the West Coast started two major regions and communities, one named Dor - o taur and the other called Puig Gwilith.  The existing elves that were already populating the lands did not agree or get along with the new elves and were invited undergroup by the orignal dwarves of the lands, starting the Drow Elves race of elves.  

On the East Coast the humans and various races settled into Echor and then moved down the East Coast settling in large towns like Waterdeep and Vad Nogaak Meth.  

The races from the East Coast not happy with the land they had started to move westward toward the west coast and setteled in Detoixit, Dakota, and the Frozen Land.

### The New Gods

While most of the history was lost during the Titan Wars, what is understood is that a group of humans, dwarves, elves discovered some acient artifacts that allowed the old gods (Titans) to walk the lands.  The titans started to gain the flaws of the people that walked the lands like greed and this eventually started the Titan wars.  This war ravaged the land and most of the cities were greatly destroyed.  The cloud giants seeing this happening and fearing all history would be lost fled to Eshiya and created the "Rift", a magical barrier in the middle of the ocean that restricts anyone from entering the land of the Old World.

The people of the New World unable to flee back to the Old World were left to suffer and many lives were lost.  A band of adventures listed below found the courage to make a deal with the Dragons and Giants to use acient artifacts to destory the Titans, thus returning the lands to peace.  The group of adventures were:

- Tharnaus (human paladin leader)
- Tor (dwarf best friend of Tharnaus)
- Athenia (human wife of Tharaus)
- Hadies (rogue human brother of Tharnaus)
- Mxyzpixel (halfling)
- Paltar (human)
- Silvanus (elf twin sister of Thymisis)
- Thymisis (elf twin sister of Silvanus)

In order to kill and lock the Titans from never returning the group of adventures had to give there souls to kill the Titans.  As apart of this banishment there souls were transfered to the plane that the original Titans came from, thus during them into the New Gods that are known in the lands today.  

## Dragons

The dragons of the world didn't fair well and there numbers before the wars were over 20,000.  While no one knows how many are left, but the Elves of Puig Gwilith whom track the modern history of the lands estimate there numbers are less than 1,000.  The known Dragons in the lands have been spotted around:

- Dragon Tooth Mountain Peak (Blue Dragons)
- Tyon Desert (Red Dragons)
- Frozen Lands (Blue/White Dragons)
- Grazien Mountains south of Echor (Green Dragon)

It is rumored that the lands to the south are were most of the dragons make home with rumors of large beasts in jungles called Dinosaurs that they feed off of.

## Giants

### Frost Giants

The Frost Giants of the lands fled far north to the Frozen Lands and are rarely spotted unless adventures move north of the dark lands of Dakota, Calmarnock, Echor, or Dór -o sídh.  It is recorded in the year 282 AT a large force of Frost Giants attacked the city of Dór -o sídh and in the results several pre-war artifacts were lost along with most of the city including the great library of history which was one of the only last records of times before the war.  The Frost Giants claimed the elves were hiding a great artifact that originally belonged to them from them.  This broke the peace between the people of the New World and the Frost Giants.

### Hill Giants

The Hill Giants roam the Bison Plains and lands of Kez Kor Googa.  Before the Titan Wars, the Hill Giants were as intelligent as the Cloud Giants with the strength of the Fire Giants.  The Hill Giants started the treaty between the humans and the Giants in order to stop the Titans.  The friendship grew between the two and eventually a race of beings called the Golaiths was started when humans started to mate with the Hill Giants.  The titans fearing this relationship would destory them cursed all Hill Giants, taking there size, strength, and intelligence from them.  Since the fall of the titans and the end of the Titan War, many of them have banded with Hobgoblins, Goblins, and Bug Bears to take the lands from the honorable Orc and Golaith tribes.

### Fire Giants

The Fire Giants are rumored to have a great fortress in the mountains in the south of Tyon Desert. Not much is known about them and very people that have seen them have lived to tell. 

### Cloud Giants

The Cloud Giants fled the lands during the Titan war and created the Rift, a magical barrier in the oceans to the east and west that lock the people in the New Lands from being able to return to the Old Lands.

### Storm Giants

Much is not known about them other than they are the most powerful of the giants and in accient times had a palace called Atlantis that scholars state is located somewhere in the waters south of Vad Aroiga.

## Great Silence

The people that survived the Titan War, angered by the destruction of the old gods (Titans), started the great silence by banning worship of the Titans and the new gods.  Anyone worshiping gods must do this in private/in secrete in non-elvish cities.  

## Current

The date is 395 AT (After Titans).  Much records of time were lost and very little is known about the times of before the War of Titans.  The original titans went to world with the new gods, giants and dragons.  This war lasted over 100 years and most of the lands were greatly destroyed in the process, with over 98% of the worlds population lost in the war.

In the almost 400 years following the war, the world population is starting to recover, relationships between the races are starting to mend, and cities are starting to pop-up around the lands.  Routes between cities are still very dangerous and most traveling caravans require adventures or hired mercenaries to protect them from the new evil monsters and forces that stock the lands.
