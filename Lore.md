## Introduction

The date is 380 AT (After Titans).  Much records of time were lost and very little is known about the times of before the War of Titans.  The original titans went to world with the new gods, giants and dragons.  This war lasted over 100 years and most of the lands were greatly destroyed in the process, with over 98% of the worlds population lost in the war.  

## Great Silence

The people that survived the war started the great silence by banning worship of the Titans and the new gods, thus anyone worshiping gods must do this in private/in secrete in non-elvish cities.  The two major lands of the elves were greatly damanged from barbarians and giant attacks and much of there great libraries were lost. 

## Current
In the almost 400 years following the war, the world population is starting to recover, relationships between the races are starting to mend, and cities are starting to pop-up around the lands.  Routes between cities are still very dangerous and most traveling caravans require adventures or hired mercenaries to protect them from the new evil monsters and forces that stock the lands.
