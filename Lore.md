## Introduction

The date is 380 AT (After Titans).  Much records of time were lost and very little is known about the times of before the War of Titans.  The original titans went to world with the new gods, giants and dragons.  This war lasted over 100 years and most of the lands were greatly destroyed in the process, with over 98% of the worlds population lost in the war.

## Dragons

The dragons of the world didn't fair well and there numbers before the war were over 20,000.  While no one knows how many are left, the Elves of Puig Gwilith whom track the modern history of the lands estimate less than 1,000 are left.  The known Dragons in the lands have been spotted around:

- Dragon Tooth Mountain Peak (Blue Dragons)
- Tyon Desert (Red Dragons)
- Frozen Lands (Blue/White Dragons)
- Grazien Mountains south of Echor (Green Dragon)

It is rumored that the lands to the south are were most of the dragons make home with rumors of large beasts in jungles called Dinosaurs that they feed off of.   

## Giants

### Frost Giants

The Frost Giants of the lands fled far north to the Frozen Lands and are rarely spotted unless adventures move north of the dark lands of Dakota, Calmarnock, Echor, or Dór -o sídh.  It is recorded in the year 282 AT a large force of Frost Giants attacked the city of Dór -o sídh and in the results several pre-war artifacts were lost along with most of the city including the great library of history which was one of the only last records of times before the war.

### Hill Giants

The Hill Giants roam the Bison Plains and lands of Kez Kor Googa.  Many of them have banded with Hobgoblins, Goblins, and Bug Bears to take the lands from the honorable Orc and Golaith tribes.

### Fire Giants

The Fire Giants are rumored to have a great fortress in the mountains in the south of Tyon Desert. Not much is known about them and very people that have seen them have lived to tell.

### Cloud Giants

The Cloud Giants fled the lands after the great war and it's rumored that they fled via the great sea of the west.

### Storm Giants

Much is not known about them other than they are the most powerful of the giants and in accient times had a palace called Atlantis that scholars state is located somewhere in the waters south of Vad Aroiga.


## Great Silence

The people that survived the war started the great silence by banning worship of the Titans and the new gods, thus anyone worshiping gods must do this in private/in secrete in non-elvish cities.  The two major lands of the elves were greatly damanged from barbarians and giant attacks and much of there great libraries were lost. 

## Current
In the almost 400 years following the war, the world population is starting to recover, relationships between the races are starting to mend, and cities are starting to pop-up around the lands.  Routes between cities are still very dangerous and most traveling caravans require adventures or hired mercenaries to protect them from the new evil monsters and forces that stock the lands.
